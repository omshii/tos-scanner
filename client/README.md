## To run the client

Just run `npm run serve:dev`. Note that this is just for developing the client website and will not activate any server functionality (i.e., all API requests will fail). If you want the full thing, then run `npm run build:dev` and then go to the server and do `npm run serve:dev` in the server directory.
